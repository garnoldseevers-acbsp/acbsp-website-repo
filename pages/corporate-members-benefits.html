As of January 2015, the number of individuals in our database exceeded 11,000 — at 1,297 member campuses. When the educational institution joins, individual member benefits are extended to the president, chief academic officer, head of the business unit, and faculty. Think of the possibilities!

            Business Education Week
        </h3>
        <p>
            This e-newsletter is sent most Fridays (excluding holidays and our every-other-week summer schedule, July 4-Labor Day). It is more of a week-in-review, providing links to popular articles in the business education/accreditation space. I include 1-2 announcements/reminders from the home office that are usually conference related or reminding our members of an upcoming deadline to apply for an award or respond to a call for presentations. I also include a "Members in the News" link to an article that pops up in my Google or TrendKite Alert about our educational or corporate members. If you send out a press release via wire or show up in any media outlet, please send me a link to either (or both) and I will add it to our “Members in the News” section of the website and in an upcoming Business Education Week email.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a corporate member, you receive one complimentary sponsorship of Business Education Week. In that issue, we will include a message that reads: This issue sponsored by: (with your logo). You would also be able to include a complimentary ad for that week — either a horizontal banner ad that would run across the bottom of the email template (600 x 200 px) or a box ad that would run in the right rail (164 x 200 px).

        <p>
            This publication is best if you want to include an article, rather than in Business Education Week, which is more curated content. We include a “Corporate Member Spotlight” that outlines what you do, any product or service you want to highlight, a product photo and logo and a sentence at the end that says how long you’ve been a corporate member. That is always kept to one 8.5” x 11” page.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re also welcome to submit an article to ACBSP Impact magazine. It needs to address a need or answer a question that our audience might have, without being too “salesy.” That needs to take up no more than two pages, including any images you have. Include a byline so we can give proper credit and a sentence at the end can include a contact name and your web address for more information. I can’t run an article in every issue. With only four issues a year and multiple corporate members, I can accept one article per year. You can pick the issue that best suits your needs though and I will try my best to accommodate your request.

            You can also submit an article to our ACBSP Impact blog. If you submit three or more articles, you can become a regular contributor. Again, these articles are meant to help our members address the challenges they face in delivering quality business education, developing relevant curriculum that prepares their students for a competitive job market, and measures student learning outcomes effectively. You can submit these articles directly to me. I will approve and post for you, unless you want to become a regular contributor. In that case, you could post the article and it would come to me for approval.

            A lot is offered through ACBSP membership and it can be overwhelming. ACBSP offers to send a member of the ACBSP staff to your headquarters or other location to meet with decision makers and sales representatives. This can be a review of various products and services you offer and your current marketing plan to determine how corporate membership can be used as a part of the plan. ACBSP staff will also review ways in which you access the member directory and other resources on acbsp.org.
