                Student Leadership Award
            </h3>
            <p>
                The ACBSP Student Leadership Award was created in order to recognize student leadership. No other business school accrediting body has an award like it. Once presented, the student may use this recognition on a resume and be honored at a graduation or honor awards assembly. The availability of a perpetual plaque in the wall of the business school adds value for the student long after departure from the college or university campus and is visible evidence to all visitors that the business unit supports leadership within the student body.
