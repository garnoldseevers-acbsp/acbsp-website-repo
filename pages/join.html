        If your institution can identify itself as one of the following institution types, you are eligible to join ACBSP:
    </span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Any Associate Degree institution in the United States, regionally accredited, and granting the associate degree as its highest degree.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any Baccalaureate/Graduate Degree institution in the United States,  regionally accredited and offering a baccalaureate or major in business and/or graduate degree in business.
    </li>
    <li>
        An international degree-granting institution awarding degrees outside of the United States. The institution must provide a certified translation of an official document from an appropriate government organization in their respective countries stating recognition, accreditation and/or their right to grant degrees. After review of the application by the ACBSP Board of Directors, international degree-granting institutions may be granted membership in this category or as an Associate Degree or a Baccalaureate/Graduate Degree institution. This information will be verified before membership is granted.

        Institutions that join to pursue the ACBSP accreditation process are referred to as institutional members. Institutional members that join ACBSP are allowed to submit the names of individual members that they wish to have on file with ACBSP. These can include the President of the institution, Champion/Co-Champion, faculty members, and other staff members. The individuals listed will then receive a username and password to our website, acbsp.org. Hence, they will be able to access member benefits, such as ACBSP’s publications.
    </span>
    <span>
        At any time that an individual member chooses to be removed from our listing, a request can be submitted to the ACBSP headquarters.

        ACBSP membership offers a rich variety of benefits in addition to accreditation. Members are invited and receive special pricing to attend ACBSP events, such as ACBSP Conference. Members also have several opportunities to publish a paper or present at an ACBSP event. Additionally, there are several award opportunities available. Other perks include: access to ACBSP publications, past-conference proceedings, and a global membership directory to name a few. Members can also get involved in ACBSP committees and boards of their liking.

<p>
    <span>
        Membership is granted to schools that are not seeking accreditation, but desiring other benefits of joining the ACBSP membership. Most ACBSP members, however, do seek accreditation.
