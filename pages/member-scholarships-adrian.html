                The Adrian Rubin Scholarship was created with our leaders of the future (current students) in mind. Over the years, college has become increasingly expensive and necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This scholarship serves the purpose of being able to help one student get closer to achieving their goal of landing their dream career without having to rack up hundreds of thousands of student loan debt in order to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applicants will be required to answer a simple question in the form of a short essay and the winner will be selected based on the essay submitted. A committee led by Adrian Rubin will select a winner by the end of August 2019. This winner will receive $1,200 towards their higher education, which will be sent directly to their school’s financial aid department.
