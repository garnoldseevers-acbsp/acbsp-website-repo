        Evaluators and Mentors

        Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
        ACBSP offers training to become a volunteer mentor and/or evaluator for ACBSP schools going through the initial accreditation and re-affirmation processes.
    </p>
    <!--
        One of the truly rewarding opportunities on your pathway to involvement is as a site
team evaluator. Following are a few of the many benefits of serving in this role.
 Imagine the value of reading a self-study to learn the various qualities of the school
being visited. This is a unique opportunity to see best practices – and less than
best practices – being used. While the identity and circumstances of the school
remain confidential, you can use this experience in the administration of the
business unit on your campus, including work on your self-study or quality
assurance report.
 Through your involvement, you are able to network with other ACBSP members
from various geographic areas. Members serving together become friends and
colleagues through the experience.
 You meet faculty, students, alumni, and administrators at the school visited and
have an opportunity to serve as an ACBSP ambassador on behalf of all those
involved in the accreditation process.
 Each site visit involves travel to a destination you may not have experienced
previously and maybe never will, except for this opportunity. Many members enjoy
the opportunity to visit other countries.
 Your role as a site team evaluator may increase the support by the business unit to
fund your travel and registration fee to the Annual Conference.
35
 During your tenure you have the opportunity to serve as Chair of a site team. Such
an opportunity provides leadership experience in conducting business and team
coordination, a valued skill for your professional and personal development.
 As a Chair, you qualify for another pathway to ACBSP involvement – to serve as a
mentor (as outlined in the next section) or as a member of the ACBSP Board of
Commissioners.
 Committee participation can be added to your résumé which could lead to
increased consideration for tenure and for promotion on your campus.
