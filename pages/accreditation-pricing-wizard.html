                </h3>
                <p class="expandable">
                    An evaluation team is assigned soon after receiving the Intent to Submit a Self-Study for Initial ACBSP Accreditation. The school is asked if a team member may not be a good fit or if they feel there could be a conflict of interest. The estimated cost assumes a combination of site team members from the USA and from the country or adjoining countries. The site team files its report with ACBSP within two weeks after their visit. The cost for the team visit will be deducted from the $4,000 deposit. Any funds remaining will be returned to the school. Any required balance will be invoiced to the school.
                </p>
                <p class="expandable">
                    For planning purposes, ACBSP recommends allocating between $5,000 and $9,000 for the evaluation team site visit. Site visit costs may fall below or exceed the amounts listed, depending on the institution’s location, geographic location of the site team members, and the number of campuses seeking accreditation within a school system. The accreditation staff can help with a more exact figure as you make your budget plans.
                </p>
                <p class="expandable">
                    The business school being visited is responsible for reimbursing ACBSP for all of the costs of the team visit. ACBSP will pay each evaluator after they file an expense reimbursement claim with receipts attached ACBSP will then bill the business school for all of the costs incurred by the team. The deposit balance will be reconciled, and the institution will either receive a partial return of the site visit deposit or be invoiced in the amount by which actual costs exceed the $4,000 deposit.
