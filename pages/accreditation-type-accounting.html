        Separate Accounting Program Accreditation
    </h1>
    <p>
            Nearly all of the benefits that exist for business accreditation apply to accreditation of the accounting program. It may be possible to secure funds needed to achieve this accounting accreditation through the financial support of an alumni graduate of the accounting program. If institutions should seek this funding, ACBSP can be helpful in outlining the costs and benefits for this case statement.

            Background
        </h3>
        <p>
            The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) presented alternatives for curriculum provisions, including ethics to a select joint panel of identified members of various stakeholder organizations, including NASBA, state boards of accountancy, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), state CPA societies, American Accounting Association, accrediting organizations, ethics experts and government regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office. As a result of their work, state boards of accountancy are being encouraged to adopt rules that allow students graduating from programs that have attained separate accreditation in accounting to receive less scrutiny of transcripts and to be determined to have met the recommended requirements to sit for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the 2009 Annual Conference, LaGrange College in LaGrange, Georgia became the first institution to achieve ACBSP accreditation for its accounting unit. Since that time, more institutions in ACBSP membership have achieved separate accounting accreditation.
