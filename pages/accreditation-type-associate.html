            The training provided by ACBSP fully prepares our faculty to understand the assessment process that has become so prevalent in not only specialized accreditation, but regional accreditation as well. By shifting our focus from simply teaching a course to meeting the needs on a holistic level and continuously assessing our processes, we in effect provide a more prepared worker who will thrive in the workplace.‚Äù
