            Founded in 1988, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) is a global business education accrediting body and the only organization to offer accreditation to all levels of collegiate business educational degree programs from associate to doctoral.
        </p>
        <p>
            ACBSP ignites a standard of excellence with an accreditation process based on the Baldrige Education Criteria for Performance Excellence. By evaluating aspects of leadership, strategic planning, relationships with stakeholders, quality of academic programs, faculty credentials, and educational support, ACBSP assesses whether or not business programs offer a rigorous educational experience and commitment to continuous quality improvement.

            ACBSP Accreditation
        </h3>
        <p>
            ACBSP provides a set of standards and criteria to assist ACBSP member institutions in achieving excellence in business program education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a process of self-study, on-site visitation, and assessment, business units have the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to serving students, other institutions, and industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            This distinctive accreditation approach reflects validated, leading-edge management practices which measure and engage ACBSP members and the business programs they offer for continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            ACBSP's accreditation process follows the Baldrige model. The accreditation focuses on recognizing teaching excellence, determining student learning outcomes, and a continuous improvement model. ACBSP’s student-centered teaching and learning approach, which is measured and analyzed for quality, ensures that students gain the right skills from their educational investment. Institutions with programs accredited by ACBSP are committed to continuous improvement that ensures their business program will give students the skills employers want.

                    ACBSP accreditation legitimizes our program and department. We get recognition from our administrators and others around the college. In fact, we have faculty members outside of the department asking about our assessment methods for their own programs."

                    The training provided by ACBSP fully prepares our faculty to understand the assessment process that has become so prevalent in not only specialized accreditation, but regional accreditation as well. By shifting our focus from simply teaching a course to meeting the needs on a holistic level and continuously assessing our processes, we in effect provide a more prepared worker who will thrive in the workplace."
