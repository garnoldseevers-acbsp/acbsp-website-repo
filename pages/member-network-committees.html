    <h1>
        Committees
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
        ACBSP has 16 committees that allow volunteer leaders from each region to participate in a specific area of governance or member services. The operation of ACBSP committees is implemented by policies and procedures adopted by the ACBSP Board of Directors.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fulfilling their obligations as committee members, persons generally must agree to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Participate in at least two conference calls annually (one in November and the other in early April) and one in-person meeting at the conference
        </li>
        <li>
            Be willing to take on responsibilities as assigned during meetings and fulfill these obligations in a timely matter
        </li>
        <li>
            In some cases, be willing to attend regional meetings to make a report and/or serve on a regional committee focused on the same subject area.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <!--

        There are numerous benefits to participation in the various ACBSP committees.
 Through your involvement, you are able to network with other ACBSP members from
various geographic areas. Committees consist of approximately12 members from up
to 10 different ACBSP regions.
 There is increased value in this networking through committees because members
often share a common interest. For instance, most persons serving on the Articulation
Committee have either experience in transfer of credit or an interest in how to better
achieve transfer of credit.
 You contribute to making policy and procedures for ACBSP that may be eventually
adopted and implemented. Your input is representative of your institution and similar
schools, giving a great satisfaction of participation in the governance process.
 The need to attend the Annual Conference or regional meetings is increased by your
involvement on a committee since all committees meet at the Annual Conference, and
the regional representative on a committee is often on the agenda for a report at a
regional meeting.
 During your tenure you have the opportunity to step into the role of committee chair.
Such an opportunity provides leadership experience in conducting committee
business, a valued skill for your professional and personal development.
 As chair, you qualify for another pathway to ACBSP involvement — serving as a
member of the ACBSP Board of Directors.
 Committee participation can be listed on your résumé, strengthening consideration for
tenure and promotion on your campus.
