        Certificate Program Accreditation

    <h4>
        ACBSP is the First Business Accreditor to Offer Certificate Accreditation!
    </h4>
    <p>
        Certificates provide flexibility for business schools and programs to offer diversified training in a matter of months, rather than years, preparing students to enter the workplace quickly. Companies need employees who can be trained quickly in multiple and diverse skills. Certificates fill that need and ACBSP certificate accreditation provides the validation. Just as we do for accredited business programs, ACBSP wants to partner with business schools and programs to continue providing exceptional quality education through certificate accreditation.

        These standards are on the leading edge of management practices that have been proven to work in high-performing higher education institutions.
